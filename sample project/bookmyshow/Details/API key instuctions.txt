Please note we are using the movie DB API to get movies from the remote server. To get movies from API you would need an API key.

Try this in your code:

companion object {
    private const val API_KEY = "7bc0651fe0ea5973822df3bd27e779d9"
}

We would recommend to generate your own API key and use it if above key is not working. Please follow the below steps to configure your own API key.

1. Register yourself on https://www.themoviedb.org/signup
2. Fill all the required details to signup.
3. Open your email and verify the email to get started. (Activate your account)
4. Do login with the username and the password(you provided during signup)
5. On Top right corner -> Click on your profile icon -> Settings -> API -> Request an Api Key -> Choose developer option(for demo/sample project ) -> Accept the terms -> Fill all the required details (You can give dummy value for application url as you wonâ€™t be having that, give good summary for application summary) -> Submit -> Copy API key and use.

Also, note that this will be required for Day 2 where we hit API using retrofit.
